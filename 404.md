# 404 - Page not found

## How did we get here?

Look I'll be honest with you, I have no idea.
But I'm sure we can find something worth your time!

If you clicked a link and expected to go somewhere different, you can [open an issue and report this as a bug]({{ page.bug-tracker }}) on the repository that builds the website.
That would be great if you could.

Otherwise, I guess you can use the navigation bar over on the left to go back to somewhere with more information?
Or stay here for a bit and marvel in the achievement of finding a bug in my website.
