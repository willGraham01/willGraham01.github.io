                These notes have been produced on request, intended as a suppliment to the tutorials that I give.
				The main purpose is to provide hints for the non-homework questions; which the tutorials sometimes miss out due to time constraints, however they will also include anything from the notes that I deem worthy of highlighting and the homework hints I provide (if any).
				The importance of these things will range from <q>useful to know</q> to <q>FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT</q>; and whilst I will only emphasise certain things from the notes, it is important come the exam that you are familiar with all/most of the material from the lectures and not just what I have listed here.
				These notes <b><u>DO NOT</u></b> provide a substitute for the tutorial - in fact they will often explicitly refer to the tutorial (or things I said in the tutorial), so won't make sense without it!

                If there are questions about the resources you see here, drop me an <a href="mailto:W.Graham@bath.ac.uk">email</a> and I will do my best to answer promptly.
				In addition, as any of my tutees will know how hopeless I am at spelling.
				If you spot any corrections that are required here, please point them out.

            <h1 class="w3-text-teal" id="TypingMaths">Typing Mathematics</h1>
            <p>
        		I am always happy to answer questions by email if problems arise outside the tutorial.
				However when typing a problem that has come up in a question, it can become cumbersome to type out the maths in full - most of the time people resort to some makeshift notation that works in context.
				Because I have some context, this doesn't matter too much, but it would be much better if the actual mathematical expressions could be used instead, because:
        		<ul>
        			<li>For the purposes of your general mathematical education, at some point you are going to need to get familiar with writing mathematics in reports (unless you fancy writing out a 30-page project report by hand...), so it's good practice to start now.</li>
        			<li>It means I can understand your question and your point precisely, and give you a better answer in my response.</li>
        			<li>It saves us all time trying to cipher/decipher the makeshift notation!</li>
        		</ul>
        		<h6 class="w3-text-teal">In e-mails:</h6>
        		The <a href="https://mail.bath.ac.uk" target="_blank">Outlook Web App</a> used for University email supports basic equation functionality, via the "Insert" tab.
				This is obviously not ideal for questions that are notation-heavy though, in which case I'd encourage you to simply attach a picture or .pdf document to your email with the expressions you need for your question.
        		<h6 class="w3-text-teal">A Broader Context (LaTeX):</h6>
				<img src="Images/MS_Word_image_move.jpg" title="Moving an image in Word" alt="" style="width:auto; height:100%; max-height:200px" align="right"/>
        		Those of you who forsee youselves working with maths for a long time, and having to write maths-heavy reports (particularly those of you on Masters courses) may find it useful to start familiarising yourselves with a <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX</a> editor.
				Here's an image which should give you a reason as to why this is a good idea.
        		<ul>
        			<li>LaTeX isn't perfect so don't think I'm shooting down software like MS Word or iOS Pages, they have their merits.
					In particular the spellchecking features easily surpass most LaTeX editors, and learning to work without a GUI is quite technical at first.
					However the ease of use in LaTeX and the far less clunky way it handles images, equations and report formalities put it ahead, particularly for a scientific writer.</li>
        		</ul>
        		LaTeX is a typesetting system, specifically designed for scientific writing.
				It is freely available and has many editors, both downloadable and online, which come ready-to-use and even include document templates.
				Editors can appear confusing at first, but there are plenty of <a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/blog/latex-guides/beginners-tutorial.html" target="_blank">tutorials</a> to help you get started.
				I shalln't go into the details here, because I have literally just given a link to a whole website dedicated to guides and more, and because you can normally solve any problem you have in LaTeX simply by Google-ing it.
        		<ul>
        			<li>Those of you who are on the MMath will have an introduction to LaTeX as preparation for your Master's project, in your 4th year.</li>
        		</ul>

			<h1 class="w3-text-teal" id="FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<p>
				Here I've tried to include some of the more common questions that I field in tutorials and outside of tutorials, about the website, structure of courses, exams, etc. If your question doesn't appear on the list you can <a href="mailto:W.Graham@bath.ac.uk">email me</a>.
				<h6 class="w3-text-teal">About these tutorial notes...</h6>
					<ul>
						<li>See the <a href="#About">About and Disclaimer</a> section.
						The notes <b><i>DO NOT</i></b> provide a substitute for the tutorial, and by no means provide complete coverage of all the topics in the course.
						You are always advised to follow the advice of the lecturer on matters relating to this.</li>
						<li>I put the notes up either the day of- or the day after my final tutorial of each week.
						I am known to forget, and if they don't appear once this grace period has expired, remind me.</li>
					</ul>
                <!--
				<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Hand-ins</h6>
					<ul>
						<li>The hand-in time and date changes each year with lecture scheduling.
						I tend to put a reminder above the section for that semester.</li>
						<li>Most problem sheets have designated <q>homework</q> questions for hand-in, although I will try to mark everything that you hand-in if I have time.</li>
						<li>When handing in work you will often be handing in more than one piece of paper.
						To reduce the risk pages being disordered/lost in the chaos of handing-in, consider stacking your pages in order and then folding the top-left corner over (so that the corner of the last page now wraps round the other pages above it).</li>
						<li>If you have done work but missed the hand-in deadline for that problem sheet, hand-in your work the following week (along with anything from <i>that</i> week too) and I will mark both for the following tutorial.</li>
						<li>Any marked work not collected in the tutorial will remain in the folder, so you can pick it up at any time (like when you hand in the next week).
						I don't know the fate of work that is not collected by the end of the semester, but it won't be in the pigeonhole folders anymore!
						I assume it is incinerated.</li>
					</ul>
                -->
				<h6 class="w3-text-teal">Exam (revision)</h6>
				<ul>
					<li>You can normally find the previous 5 years worth of past papers on the <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/library/exampapers/" target="_blank">library website</a> by entering the unit code.</li>
					<li>On moodle there may be a document outlining what you are expected to know going into the exam, and what kinds of things you can expect to be asked.
					My general rule of thumb is to make sure you understand the lecture notes and the problem sheet questions; this should set you up OK for the exam but pay attention to what the lecturer says/what's on moodle for more specific guidance.
					Note that <q>understand</q> includes an appreciation for the concepts/ideas behind the answers that are presented, not just <q>I can remember the answer</q>.</li>
