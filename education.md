Talking about myself is usually rather dull and tiresome for the other party involved; but here you can see a summary of my education, work and research experience, and personal interests.
So if you're looking for a brief summary, the TLDR is below:

- PhD Statistical Applied Mathematics,
- MSci Mathematics and Physics,
- Multiple programming language fluencies and familiarities,
- Experience working on several large, collaborative projects,
- Multiple organisational roles in a casual and formal setting.

### Research Software Developer

<i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i> 2022 - present, <i class="fa fa-building fa-fw w3-margin"></i> Centre for Advanced Research Computing, University College London

Research software developers (RSE/Ds) within ARC work on a wide range of academic projects that are both lead by the Centre for Advanced Research Computing, and run in collaboration with other departments internal and external to UCL.
Projects can range between 1 month developments to continual support and maintenance of research software, with RSEs typically working on up to 2 projects at a time.
There is a great diversity in the research contexts, software tools, and deliverable outcomes of the projects that ARC is involved with - and the RSEs within the team have the skillset to jump into a project and rapidly apply their expertise to progress the project.

RSEs within ARC also coordinate a number of the department's teaching activities, as well as contribute to the development and delivery of internal (to UCL) and external training materials and communities.

During my time at ARC, I have worked on;

- Improving a legacy finite-element codebase for simulating the folding of organic tissue.
- [Simulating light through matter with applications in medical imaging and optics](https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/research-software-development/simulating-light-propagation-through-matter/){:target="_blank"}.
- [Profiling the Thanzi la Onse healthcare-system](https://www.tlomodel.org/) modelling project.
- [Development of a consistent tooling structure for the BrainGlobe project](https://brainglobe.info/blog/version1/version_1_announcement.html){:target="_blank"}.

I've also been involved in ARC's education activities as a module lead and organiser for the Software Carpentry workshops, which you can read about [on this page](teaching#as-part-of-ucl-arc-university-college-london).

### Data Analyst

<i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i> Summer (July - Sept) of 2013, 2014, and 2016, <i class="fa fa-building fa-fw w3-margin"></i> Permasense Ltd.

Permasense Ltd. is an Imperial Innovations startup company that develops and manufactures remote corrosion and erosion monitoring systems, which has since been acquired by Emerson.
During my experience at Permasense I undertook a number of roles and tasks, including:

- Analysis of field data for developing improvements to the user interface and its features (2013/16).
- Investigations and experiments simulating hardware performance in extreme environments (2014).
- Revision and writing of internal test scripts (2016).

### Additional Work and Research Experience

<details>
    <summary>Integrative Think Tanks (ITTs)</summary>
    I have participated in SAMBa's 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th ITTs during my time as part of the CDT.
    ITTs are a week-long event in which industrial partners of SAMBa are invited to present problems faced by their industry.
    Students, academics, and employees work together to turn these problems into mathematical questions that can be solved, or taken forward as a PhD project to address the original problems presented in industry.
    This develops the students' ability to rapidly take in and understand new concepts and information, collaborate with experts in a different field to theirs, and provides practice in then presenting their results back to a variety of audiences.

### Programming Competencies

Experience working in the following languages for research and/or employment purposes:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/), including extensive experience teaching this language.
- [C++](https://isocpp.org/), including experience teaching this language.
- [C](https://www.iso.org/standard/74528.html), [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/), and [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html),

I'm also familiar with [Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/) and document typesetting [with $$\LaTeX$$](https://latex-project.org/) and creating diagrams in [TikZ](https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgf) (far too familiar with the latter, to be honest).
I also managed to piece this website together, and write a simple webapp for internal UCL assessment purposes, although I wouldn't say I'm super in the know about web development tools.

### Organisational Skills

- Organiser for UCL-ARC's Software Carpentry workshops, 2022 - present.
- <details>
    <summary>SAMBa Summer Conference Organiser, 2019</summary>
    I was one of 5 SAMBa students co-organising the SAMBa Summer Conference in July 2019.
    The SAMBa conference is an opportunity for students to showcase their current (or future) work to members of the department, outside the department and at other Universities in a supportive environment.
    The work of SAMBa students covers the entire spectrum of statistical applied mathematics: including projects in statistics, probability, analysis, numerical analysis, mathematical biology, fluid dynamics, machine learning and high performance computing.
    The conference and its associated activities are organised and run by students and contains talks by SAMBa students, external speakers, and students from other departments and institutions.
  </details>
- I've also had a number of informal organisational roles; as team captain for casual-league football during my PhD, and playing captain for a team in [the 4NCL](https://www.4ncl.co.uk/).
