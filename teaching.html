        I find teaching and tutoring to be a rewarding experience in of itself, and consequentally have been heavily involved in a number of teaching activities and roles since the third year of my undergraduate studies.
        My experience includes the delivery of tutorials to mathematics undergraduates, introductory courses in Python to postgraduate researchers, and software induction training for postgraduate students.
        You can read more about the specifics of these roles below.

            Tutors for the Department of Mathematical Sciences take between 1 and 3 groups per teaching term, for a one hour session each week that focuses on one of the modules those students are studying as part of their degree.
            In this session tutors are expected to answer questions from their students about the material from the lectures of that module, and cover example questions to support the students learning.
            Tutors are also expected to mark and provide feedback on the work produced by their students, and to spend up to one hour preparing the material for each tutorial.

            Part of the Doctoral College's role at the University of Bath is to provide courses for postgraduate students to develop their skills as a researcher.
            As such, the College offers a number of introductory and intermediate programming skills sessions (focusing on Python and the UNIX command line) to all research students at the University, running one programme of these courses each university term.
            Demonstrators during these sessions are required to support the learning of attendees by answering any questions that arise whilst students work through the course material.
            They may additionally take on the <q>lead</q>/<q>instructor</q> role for a session, whereby they are responsible for leading the teaching portion of the session, in addition to the previous responsibilities.

        </h6>
        <p class="w3-medium">
            For three academic years I have been involved with preparing the material for, and demonstrating at, the SAMBa induction sessions at the beginning of the academic year.
            In 2018 and 19, I helped write the teaching material for the MATLAB and LaTeX courses which were run, and took a supporting role in the induction sessions.
            In 2020, I oversaw the process of reviewing the course material and organising the induction sessions.
            More details on the content of the induction courses can be found <a href="https://people.bath.ac.uk/wg270/SAMBa_Induction.html" class="w3-hover-opacity" target="_blank">on this page</a> (hosted until I leave the University of Bath).
        </p>
        <p class="w3-medium">
            A core pillar of the training provided by SAMBa in the MRes year is to provide students with experience and familiarity with how computing is used to enhance or support mathematical research, which encompasses a wide range of applications and hence programming languages.
            SAMBa provides a short, self-paced introductory course for each of the langauges that students are expected to use at some point during their MRes year (at least one of which is likely to be used during their PhD).
            This material is produced, organised, and maintained by SAMBa students who are currently in the PhD years of the SAMBa programme, and is reviewed each year to ensure that changes to the SAMBa program are reflected in the training that is provided.
            Unlike more general courses in programming, these courses provide a background that leans heavily on the techniques that a student will be expected to employ whilst using each language: the MATLAB course focuses on array manipulation, efficient programming, and iterative methods, for example, because this encompasses the ways in which MATLAB is employed in the repective MRes units.
