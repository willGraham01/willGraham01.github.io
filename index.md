I am a Research Software Developer at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), currently working in the Centre for [Advanced Research Computing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/) (ARC).
Before then, I was a PhD student at the University of Bath; part of the 4th cohort of the [SAMBa Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.bath.ac.uk/centres-for-doctoral-training/epsrc-centre-for-doctoral-training-in-statistical-applied-mathematics-samba/) (SAMBa CDT).
Contrary to initial implications, SAMBa is short for "Statistical Applied Mathematics at BAth", so my dancing skills leave something to be desired.
