I am a Research Software Developer at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), currently working in the Centre for [Advanced Research Computing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/) (ARC).
During my time with the group, I've worked on a number of software projects in areas including biomedical physics, cellular biology, neuroscience, and healthcare.
I've also been heavily involved in a number of ARC's teaching activities; such as organising our software carpentry workshops and leading on our Introduction To Research Software Computing module that is offered to postgraduate students.

Before then, I was a PhD student at the University of Bath; part of the 4th cohort of the [SAMBa Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.bath.ac.uk/centres-for-doctoral-training/epsrc-centre-for-doctoral-training-in-statistical-applied-mathematics-samba/) (SAMBa CDT).
Contrary to initial implications, SAMBa is short for "Statistical Applied Mathematics at BAth", so my dancing skills leave something to be desired.
